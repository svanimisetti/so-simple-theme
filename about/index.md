On this corner of the world-wide-web, I hope to document my experience and thoughts through a series of blogs and articles.

**DISCLAIMER**

Some of the articles and blogs have been painstakingly restroed from previous blogging sites (blogger and wordpress), so some formatting or typographical mistakes may be evident.

## So Simple Theme is all about:

* Responsive templates. Looking good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* [Custom 404 page]({{ site.url }}/404.html) to get you started. [^1]
* [Simple site search](https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search)

[^1]: Example: *domain.com/category-name/post-title*
