On this corner of the world-wide-web, I hope to document my experience and thoughts through a series of blogs and articles. I advocate Open Source whole-heartedly, especially in technology areas that have tremendous societal benefit. I have attempted to release some of my codes developed during spare time on hobby projects.

Also, I have tried to assemble a compendium of fast-pace instructions on a wide variety of tools on which I accumulated experience during my professional career and hobby explorations. I hope to incorporate video instructions, but that's a project for later. I hope the information on this website helps you in some form or the other. Thanks for visiting!

**DISCLAIMER**

Some of the articles and blogs have been painstakingly restroed from previous blogging sites (blogger and wordpress), so some formatting or typographical mistakes may be evident. Please do leave a comment/suggestion on the article Disqus board.
